(CRHM) Comprehensive Respiratory Health Monitor

A wearable bluetooth-enabled Arduino Pulse Oximeter. 

Last year I bought one of these new blood oximeters from eBay. The amazing little gadget clips on your finger, shines a red light into it, and measures the % saturation of Oxygen. It was enlightening to check my blood-oxygen levels periodically to learn about my respiratory health. This gadget is a tool which helped me correct bad habits, achieve better health. 

I thought it would be interesting to collect data continuously throughout my normal daily activities, and learn how well I am breathing. 

With this device I took it to the next level by also measuring ambient CO2. This bluetooth-enabled wearable device can measure Pulse Oximetry, and ambient CO2 24/7.

By monitoring oxygen levels in the body, and CO2 levels outside the body, a comprehensive data set about general respiratory/circulatory health, as well as environmental health risks can be assessed.

More info coming soon.
